# SSO Integration

Identity is delegated to **`authentication.unlikeotherai.com`** (UOA —
"UnlikeOtherAuthenticator"). This document records the contract because UOA is
**not** a drop-in OIDC provider; the brief refers to OIDC generically, but UOA
is a custom OAuth 2.0 service with a signed-config trust model.

## Key differences from plain OIDC

- **No OIDC discovery document.** There is no `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- **No JWKS endpoint.** Access tokens are signed with HS256 using the
  provider's `SHARED_SECRET`, which every trusted client also holds. There
  are no rotating public keys to fetch.
- **Client identity = domain + shared secret.** A client is identified by
  the SHA-256 (or HMAC, exact scheme recorded in UOA docs) of
  `domain + SHARED_SECRET`. That hash is sent as a `Bearer` token on the
  server-to-server `/auth/token` call.
- **Client config is a signed JWT.** The client serves a public URL whose
  body is a JWT (HS256, `SHARED_SECRET`) describing enabled auth methods,
  allowed redirect URLs, theme, 2FA, etc. UOA fetches and verifies this JWT
  on every auth initiation.
- **Access token is an HS256 JWT**, 15–60 min TTL, paired with a rotating
  opaque refresh token. User-context API calls to UOA use the header
  `X-UOA-Access-Token: <access_token>`.
- Revocation endpoint is `POST /auth/revoke`.

## Environment variables (server-side)

```
UOA_BASE_URL=https://authentication.unlikeotherai.com
UOA_DOMAIN=<this server's domain>
UOA_SHARED_SECRET=<set via secret mgr>        # HS256 signing key
UOA_AUDIENCE=auth.unlikeotherai.com           # JWT aud claim expected by UOA
UOA_CONFIG_URL=https://<domain>/auth/uoa-config
UOA_REDIRECT_URL=https://<domain>/auth/callback
UOA_OWNER_SUB=<the single user's UOA sub>
```

Secrets never live in the repo. For local dev, use `.env` (gitignored).

## Flow

### 1. Serve the signed client config

The server exposes a public endpoint that returns a signed JWT describing
itself as a UOA client:

```
GET /auth/uoa-config  ->  application/jwt
```

Claims:

```json
{
  "aud": "auth.unlikeotherai.com",
  "domain": "<this server's domain>",
  "redirect_urls": ["https://<domain>/auth/callback"],
  "enabled_auth_methods": ["email", "google", "apple"],
  "user_scope": "global",
  "ui_theme": {},
  "language_config": "en"
}
```

Signed with `UOA_SHARED_SECRET` (HS256).

### 2. User starts auth

The client (browser or mobile app) opens:

```
https://authentication.unlikeotherai.com/oauth/authorize
  ?config_url=https%3A%2F%2F<domain>%2Fauth%2Fuoa-config
```

UOA fetches the config, verifies it, renders the login UI, and on success
redirects to `UOA_REDIRECT_URL` with a `code` query parameter.

### 3. Code exchange

The server exchanges the code for an access/refresh pair:

```
POST https://authentication.unlikeotherai.com/auth/token
Authorization: Bearer <hash(domain + SHARED_SECRET)>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "code": "<oauth_code>" }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt>",
  "refresh_token": "<opaque>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 2592000
}
```

### 4. Verify the access token

Validate the JWT locally with `golang-jwt/jwt/v5`:

- Algorithm must be `HS256`.
- Signature verified against `UOA_SHARED_SECRET`.
- `exp` must be in the future.
- `aud` (if present) must match expected audience.
- Extract `sub`, `email`, optional `org` claims.

### 5. Map to internal principal

```
UOA sub        -> User.external_id
UOA email      -> User.email
UOA name       -> User.display_name
UOA org.roles  -> User.roles  (if present; MVP ignores)
```

The server then mints its **own** short-lived internal session token (HS256
JWT, independent secret) for subsequent control-plane calls. External UOA
tokens are never forwarded to internal modules.

### 6. Single-user authorization gate

MVP policy (hardcoded, later moves to OPA):

```
allow  iff  token.sub == UOA_OWNER_SUB
```

Any authenticated UOA user whose `sub` does not match the configured owner
is rejected at the identity adapter boundary before any resource logic runs.

### 6a. Super user assignment

The **first UOA user to complete a successful login** is automatically promoted
to super user. The server detects this by checking whether `users` is empty at
the point the internal session is minted; if so, it sets `is_super = true` on
the newly created user record and stores that user's `sub` as `UOA_OWNER_SUB`
(persisted in the database, not the environment, after first-boot).

Super user status grants access to the **Ops** section of the admin UI (Relay,
System). All other authenticated users see only Devices, Sessions, and Services.

There is no UI to promote or demote super users — the role is set once at
first login and can only be changed directly in the database.

### 7. Refresh

Refresh tokens are opaque and must be stored server-side (encrypted at rest
in Postgres, never exposed to the browser). Refresh is performed via the
same `/auth/token` endpoint with grant type `refresh_token`.

### 8. Logout / revocation

```
POST https://authentication.unlikeotherai.com/auth/revoke
Authorization: Bearer <hash(domain + SHARED_SECRET)>
```

Triggered on explicit logout or on internal session revocation.

## Security notes

- `SHARED_SECRET` is the single most sensitive value in the system: it signs
  access tokens **and** is the client identity. It must be injected from a
  secret manager, not committed, not logged, not echoed in errors.
- The server is both an HMAC signer (for its config JWT) and an HMAC verifier
  (for access tokens). Because HS256 is symmetric, any attacker with this
  secret can impersonate the server **and** forge tokens. Treat the secret
  accordingly.
- When UOA adds a JWKS/asymmetric signing option in the future, switch.
- Only trust `email_verified=true` (or equivalent) before mapping an email
  to the internal `email` field.
