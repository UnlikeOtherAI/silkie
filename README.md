Selkie is a self-hosted management and administration layer for a [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)-based zero-trust overlay network. It provides device enrollment, session brokering, STUN/TURN-assisted NAT traversal, and a clean admin UI — wrapping the underlying WireGuard peer-to-peer protocol, which is open source and maintained independently.

WireGuard is developed by Jason A. Donenfeld and released under the [GPLv2 license](https://www.wireguard.com/license/). Selkie links to WireGuard userspace implementations at runtime and does not distribute WireGuard source. See [wireguard.com](https://www.wireguard.com/) and the [WireGuard GitHub organisation](https://github.com/WireGuard) for the canonical project.

## What it does

- Enrolls devices (macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) into a shared WireGuard overlay network
- Issues short-lived session tokens and brokers peer-to-peer connections via ICE/STUN/TURN
- Exposes a service catalog — each device reports its listening ports; peers connect by overlay IP
- Provides a single-page admin UI for device management, session history, relay health, and system status
- Ships a Node.js CLI daemon (`selkie`) that runs as an OS service on each enrolled device
- Provides native mobile apps (iOS and Android) for connecting to enrolled servers

## Architecture

```
Admin UI (browser, static HTML + Tailwind)
        │ HTTPS (internal session JWT)
Control Server (Go 1.23+)
   Auth · Device registry · Session broker · Policy · Audit
   PostgreSQL (durable) · Redis (ephemeral)
        │ WireGuard overlay + STUN/TURN
Selkie CLI (Node.js, runs as OS service on each device)
   WireGuard peer · Heartbeat · Service manifest reporter
```

The control server coordinates identity and session establishment. It never carries application-layer traffic — once a connection is established, peers communicate directly over the WireGuard overlay (or via TURN relay when direct paths are blocked by NAT).

## Quick start

```sh
# Copy and fill in your environment
cp .env.example .env

# Start with Docker Compose (server + postgres + redis + coturn)
docker compose up

# Enrol your first device (runs on the device being enrolled)
npm install -g selkie
selkie enroll
```

After enrollment, open the admin UI, complete SSO login — the first login becomes the super user account.
